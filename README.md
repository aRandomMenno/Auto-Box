# Python powered Bot for a couple of specific games

* You will need some software to clone your android phone screen to your computer, I personally use [srcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)
  * Make sure you usb debugging **enabled** on your android phone!

1. To get this 'bot' working first install python from `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
2. Once installed open command prompt and type `pip install pyautogui`, `pip install keyboard` & `pip install opencv-python`
3. Download the code (as zip) from this github page and extract it in an empty folder.
4. You should make your own screenshots, and modify the file path for your own computer
5. Now if you've done it correctly you can run the program.

## TODO:

1. make it so bot automaticly gives to the alien.

## features:

1. Auto opens boxes,
2. Auto clicks berries,
3. The bot by holding 's',
4. Quit by holding 'q' & 's' together to.

## Auto-Box

* Uses some *Magic* to automaticly do things in a couple of specific games.
* The code was orginally written with **python 3.11.5** & **pyautogui 0.9.54**
* This does not mean you absolutely need to use those version but it might stop working on later python versions in the *far* *far* *far* future.
* I might or might not actually maintain this repository.
