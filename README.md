# Python powered Bot for a couple of specific games

1. To get this 'bot' working first install python from `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
2. Once installed open command prompt and type `pip install pyautogui`, `pip install keyboard` & `pip install opencv-python`
3. Download the code (as zip) from this github page and extract it in an empty folder.
4. Now if you've done it correctly you can run the program.

## Auto-Box

* Uses some *Magic* to automaticly do things in a couple of specific games.
* The code was orginally written with **python 3.11.5** & **pyautogui 0.9.54**
* This does not mean you absolutely need to use those version but it might stop working on later python versions in the *far* *far* *far* future.
* I might or might not actually maintain this repository.
